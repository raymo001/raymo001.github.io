<h>PROFILE</h>
<p>I am a quantitative geneticist, with special interest in the development of statistical models that efficiently utilise omics data in the prediction of individual genomic values, be it the predicted risk scores for complex traits in humans or the estimated genomic breeding values for complex traits in farm animals. I obtained by Bachelor degree in Animal Science and Range Management from the then Federal University of Technology, (now Modibbo Adama University of Technology), Yola, Nigeria. In 2014, I enrolled in the European Masters in Animal Breeding and Genetics (EM-ABG), Erasmus Mundus program. During the first year of my master program, I worked with Dr. Esther Ellen and Dr. Tessa Brinker on estimating direct and indirect genetic effects for survival time in crossbred laying hens, the results of which were subsequently published in the Journal of animal breeding and genetics. During the second year of the master program, I moved to the Swedish University of Agricultural Science, Upsala, were I worked with Prof. Dirk Jan De Koning and Dr. Anna Maria Johansson On GWAS for bone strength in laying hens. Results from the study are now published in the journal of animal science.</p>
